# API Key Security Changes

## 🔒 Removed Environment Variable Fallback

The application has been updated to **require users to provide their own Google API keys** through the web interface. No environment variable fallback is provided for enhanced security.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Backend Changes (`backend/services/summarizer.py`)**

**Removed:**
- Environment variable fallback in `_get_api_key()` method
- `_migrate_env_key_to_db()` method
- Environment variable check in `get_api_key_source()` method

**Updated:**
- `_get_api_key()` now only retrieves API keys from the database
- Clear error message: "No API key found in database - user must provide their own API key"
- No fallback to `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")`

### 2. **Deployment Guide Updates (`DEPLOYMENT.md`)**

**Removed:**
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from environment variable examples
- References to optional API key fallback

**Updated:**
- Clear note that users must provide their own API keys
- Simplified deployment instructions
- Security-focused approach

## 🔐 Security Benefits

1. **User Control**: Each user manages their own API key
2. **No Shared Limits**: No shared API quotas between users
3. **Better Security**: No global API key that could be compromised
4. **Compliance**: Users can use their own API keys with their own quotas
5. **Transparency**: Users know exactly which API key is being used

## 🚀 How It Works Now

1. **User Registration**: Users create accounts
2. **API Key Setup**: Users add their Google API key through the web interface
3. **Secure Storage**: API keys are encrypted and stored in the database
4. **User-Specific**: Each user's requests use their own API key
5. **No Fallback**: If no API key is provided, summarization is disabled

## 📋 User Experience

- Users must add their Google API key to use summarization features
- Clear error messages guide users to add their API key
- API keys are managed through the web interface
- No technical knowledge required for API key setup

## ✅ Verification

The changes ensure that:
- ✅ No environment variable fallback exists
- ✅ Users must provide their own API keys
- ✅ Application is secure and user-controlled
- ✅ Each user has their own API quota
- ✅ No shared API keys between users

Your application is now more secure and user-focused! 🔒
