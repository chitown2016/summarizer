# Logging Improvements

## Problem
The application was logging excessive information, including full video transcripts and metadata, which was causing:
- Large log files with sensitive content
- Performance issues due to verbose logging
- Privacy concerns with transcript content in logs
- Difficulty in finding relevant log information

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive logging improvement system:

### 1. Centralized Logging Configuration
- Created `backend/utils/logging_config.py` for centralized logging management
- Implemented proper log rotation to prevent files from growing too large
- Separated logs into different files based on severity

### 2. Log File Structure
```
logs/
├── app.log          # All application logs (DEBUG level and above)
└── errors.log       # Error logs only (ERROR level)
```

### 3. Log Rotation
- **app.log**: 10MB max size, keeps 5 backup files
- **errors.log**: 5MB max size, keeps 3 backup files
- Automatic rotation when size limits are reached

### 4. Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information (file only)
- **INFO**: General application information (console + file)
- **WARNING**: Warning messages (console + file)
- **ERROR**: Error messages (console + file + error log)

### 5. Reduced Verbosity
- Removed full transcript content from logs
- Reduced metadata logging to essential information only
- Changed many INFO logs to DEBUG level
- Removed sensitive information like URLs and API keys from logs

### 6. Key Changes Made

#### Video Processor (`backend/services/video_processor.py`)
- Removed logging of full transcript content
- Reduced metadata logging verbosity
- Changed detailed processing logs to DEBUG level
- Removed URL logging for privacy

#### API Endpoints
- Updated all API files to use centralized logging
- Reduced verbose request/response logging
- Maintained essential error logging

#### Logging Configuration
- Implemented proper log formatting with timestamps
- Added log rotation to prevent file bloat
- Separated error logs for easier debugging

### 7. Benefits
- **Privacy**: No more sensitive transcript content in logs
- **Performance**: Reduced I/O overhead from excessive logging
- **Maintainability**: Easier to find relevant log information
- **Storage**: Automatic log rotation prevents disk space issues
- **Debugging**: Separated error logs for focused troubleshooting

### 8. Usage
The logging system is automatically initialized when the application starts. Logs are written to:
- Console: INFO level and above
- `logs/app.log`: DEBUG level and above
- `logs/errors.log`: ERROR level only

### 9. Testing
Run `python cleanup_logs.py` to test the logging configuration and clean up any existing log files.

### 10. Configuration
Log levels can be adjusted in `backend/utils/logging_config.py`:
- Change `root_logger.setLevel()` for overall log level
- Modify individual handler levels for specific output targets
- Adjust rotation settings for file size and backup count
