As a hiring manager, I've never looked at someone's major. I studied philosophy and environmental science. People joke about philosophy as a pathway to a career. I never even look at where anyone went to college. People stress about their major. They stress about their college. What matters is your ability to think clearly and work hard. Matt Hugan is CIO at Bitwise Asset Management, >> guiding crypto index funds and helping investors access digital assets. >> Previously CEO of ETF.com, he now connects the worlds of traditional finance and blockchain. >> Who are you? It's a good question. I'm a dad. I'm an entrepreneur. And I like to think of myself as a writer. I think if you put those three things together, that's a pretty good portrait of me. What is your mission? My mission at Bitwise. Mission in life? Uh, well, what is Bitwise? If you had to explain it to your mom, we help people invest in crypto. We use our expertise to build products that are sophisticated on the inside, but easy to understand on the outside so that you can get exposure to the space in a way that's safe and secure, low cost in many cases. >> What's the S&P 500 in crypto? Is it just owning Bitcoin? If you think crypto is just money, then it's just owning Bitcoin. But if you think crypto can be money or it can be tech, then it's owning the top 20 highquality assets. What are the crypto assets that I can buy and hold for the long term? Bitcoin. >> Bitcoin. Bitcoin. Bitcoin. >> It's not what you don't know that gets you in trouble. It's what you know for sure that ain't so. Mhm. >> How does this principle apply to those who want to become better crypto investors?

We are recording this very exciting episode from San Francisco where you were born. Are you from >> No, I moved out here about 15 years ago. So, I grew up on the East Coast, DC and then Maine and then moved out here. Yeah, about 15 years ago. But I love it here. When I uh interviewed Hunter last year for the first time, there was there's a lot of people who left San Francisco, right, for the last few years after COVID and >> and he was actually saying uh that last year he thought that the bottom was in San Francisco very bullish on the on San Francisco and saying the bottom is in, the bottom is in. >> You are one of the ones who never left. >> Yeah. >> Why? >> It has uh three things that I think are the best in the world. So, one, the outdoors here is absolutely incredible. I love being outdoors, and you can be in a major city and then be in a national forest in like 20 minutes and hiking. >> I'm not sure there are that many cities where that's true. Two, the food, I think, is unparalleled. And the three, the thing that's really real, the thing that brought me here and that's kept me here is the sense of opportunity and the ability to find other people doing interesting things. There's just a higher density of that here than there is anywhere else in the world. And I would add there's like a a nonzero sum element to it. When I'm on the east coast, feels a little bit competitive, a little bit zero sum, whereas out here it's much more collaborative and um and build together. And I know that sounds very sort of ephemeral, but for me, it's a very real feeling when I'm here. And it it keeps me here despite the the taxes and the costs and all that. Just one word on the food. >> Yeah. How is food better here than in other places? >> Well, food is great in lots of places. I'm not saying it's necessarily better here than other places. There's amazing food all around the world. Um, but the quality of produce here >> is, I think, unmatched, right? We are the the produce capital of the US. Some of the best farmland in the world, some of the best sort of organic farming and local artisal food. So the quality of that just extraordinarily high. And then you pair that with a established food scene and a wine scene, I don't know, it's pretty spectacular. I live in Berkeley across the bay and even a a bad restaurant in Berkeley is pretty fantastic. Uh there are other cities. I spent a lot of time in San Sebastian, Spain. Yeah, >> that's another place very famous for the food. >> Unbelievable food. And even the worst restaurant is really, really exceptional. Um but I experienced that here, too. You said you spent a lot of time there. How come? >> I mean a relative a lot of time. So my last company before Bitwise was ETF.com and we were virtual before anyone was virtual. So I was living on an island in Maine. Uh the founder was living in San Sebastian, Spain. The other executives were in Atlanta and in Keito and uh and so we we we flew to those various cities to get together like once a quarter. So I probably spent I don't know 10 weeks in San Sebastian, something like that. >> Amazing. Yeah. very famous for very good food. >> Yeah. >> You love good food. I do. Who are you? Who am I? I ah it's a good question. I'm I'm a a dad. That's a big part of of who I am. I have three kids. Uh I'm an entrepreneur who loves building things and loves working with people. And I like to think of myself as a writer. I sort of think through writing, clarify thoughts in my mind. Um, so I think if you put those three things together, that's a pretty good portrait of me. What is your mission? My mission at Bitwise, mission in life. Uh, well, the thing that I focused my career on, I'll answer that and then maybe I'll take a bigger picture. The thing that I focus my career on is uh improvements in financial technology that makes the world cheaper and saves people money and makes the world better uh for a lot of people. So that's what I did at ETF.com. I feel like that's why I joined crypto. Um you know, more broadly, I'm just someone who's enjoying their path through life. It's a it's a it's a fun life. It's pretty great. You said before I'm a writer, right? That's one of your three Yeah. >> three persona. >> Yeah. >> You're the CIO of Bitwise Asset Management. >> But you studied philosophy and very were very good at writing. >> Yeah. >> So you have a pretty unconventional path to where you come like where you are now, right? >> Yeah. How open-minded should student be when they think or actually stressing out um about the fact that they think that their uni university majors that they enroll in are career defining? Yeah. I I don't think that's true for a lot of reasons. You know, from my own perspective, right, I studied philosophy and environmental science. Those are, you know, people joke about philosophy as a as a pathway to a career, but it's actually a phenomenal skill because most of philosophy is uh is very hard to read. It's very complex. And your job as a philosophy major is to read really complex things and distill them in a simple way. And I think that's an extraordinary skill. But the other side of it is as a hiring manager or someone who's probably hired, you know, 50 or 100 people. I've never looked at someone's major. Maybe that helps you get your first job. I'm not sure. My first job was a Cayak guide, so I didn't follow a traditional path. Maybe it helps you get your first job. But to me, uh I never even look at when where anyone went to college. There may be four or five colleges that stand out like the the Naval Academy will stand out and maybe Stanford will stand. Everything else is like all the same. So people stress about their major, they stress about their college. What matters is your work and your ability to think clearly and work hard and that's all I've ever hired for. >> Did you stress about your major? >> No, not at all. You just trusted Destiny. >> Trusted Destiny. Um, Destiny has something good for me. >> I had a I had a lot of confidence in in myself and my uh my ability to navigate the world. When it came time to get a real job, I wrote a really great cover letter and uh I think that got me in the door and then you just work as hard as you can once that door opens. Dear When Shift Happens family, the following message is probably the single most important thing you should take away from today's podcast. If you're serious about your crypto investing journey, please take some time to learn how to self-custody your assets to make sure that nobody can take your coins away ever. If you don't learn how to be your own bank, it is very likely that one day you will lose all your hard-earned crypto. The safest way to hold your crypto is in a cold storage that we also call hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are not complicated and they give you peace of mind. I personally use a hardware wallet called Treasure. It is open source, very easy to use, and the first hardware wallet created ever. As we have like to say in crypto, not your keys, not your coin. You can order your Treasure Wallet with a 10% discount by following the link in the description down below and by using the promo code WH10. And now back to the episode. You said I had a very uh great confidence about my ability to navigate the world. Yeah. Where do you think that comes from? I think I've had that uh quiet confidence. I hope uh since I was a kid. I I don't know. I feel very comfortable. I've always felt comfortable talking to people of of of any level. That's never been intimidating to me. I've always felt um able to think and analyze and solve any problem that I wanted to wanted to tackle. It doesn't mean it's easy. It doesn't mean I'm always right, but I I've I've had that sort of quiet confidence since I was a kid. How good is it to be that confident? I don't know. I can't imagine. I don't understand the other the other perspective. I don't want to say I'm overconfident. I just feel um I feel just as confident in the ability of everyone that I that I work with uh as I do in my own abilities. I just think the reality is most people if they set their mind to it and work hard can get the thing done. >> Absolutely. >> Um I feel like people put uh put barriers in front of themselves and sort of limit themselves and um I don't I don't I don't I don't understand quite where that comes from. I don't see it in my colleagues. I don't see it in my family. I don't see it in you. >> People can do amazing things. >> That's so interesting. I was talking to with a friend the other day. We're talking about Bitwise. Uh I think seven years in, right? Y >> 10 billion in AUM. >> Yep. >> And my friend was asking like how do you get there? Right. How do you get to 10 billion in AUM? And I I was telling him I was like they've been doing that for seven years. I mean obviously it's very hard, right? And you need to do the right things and the right decisions and but it's seven years, right? Right. And it's 7 years day in and day out. And there are no you hunter like texting me at 5:00 a.m. I'm like, "Hey, the guys are up at 5:00 a.m. since freaking 7 years." Right. >> That's right. >> And so it's especially in this industry like it's so under underrated like there is so much kind of short-term noise and people who come and disappear and come and disappear and >> there's really this element of kind of discipline and consistency which is so key to entrepreneurship that is lacking. >> Yeah. And and you can like Steve Jobs I always use this quote. I think everybody does when he says like 90% of what separates or 80% I think probably 90 90% of what separates successful entrepreneurs from people who are not successful I mean entrepreneurs is just uh not stopping like pretty much I think it's completely I think that's completely true. Yeah. not stopping and not blowing yourself up if you know if you have if you have sort of a confidence in in one simple thing right in in the case of Bitwise it's that crypto will be more important in the future than it is today and the world will want you know cryptofocused asset managers it just just keeping that in mind through thick and thin uh not that there haven't been challenging moments right like 2018 was very challenging >> um there were some dark periods but >> you If you if you rewrote the thesis on crypto and the thesis on a crypto asset manager, then why wouldn't you just continue? I think it's a I think it's a once in a-lifetime opportunity. I feel enormously lucky uh to be involved in crypto at this stage and of course 7 years ago, you know, just as lucky. That was a that was a rare opportunity. I feel like it's probably once in a lifetime. So you say that's very interesting. you say need to kind of re uh uh underwrite the thesis that crypto is here for the long term and therefore we will need asset managers. You told me the other day that you're pretty good at simplifying crypto >> to what it is at its core. So let's start with the very basics. You have an 11year-old child at home. >> Yeah. >> What is crypto if you had to explain it to your 11year-old child? >> Oh wow. That's a good question. What is crypto? I'll I'll I'll start by saying that he's grown up with crypto, right? So, I've been a bit wise since he was four. >> He doesn't remember when he was four. >> So, his entire life, you know, this has been as real a part of the world as any other part of the world that that he operates uh operates in. If I had to explain it to him, where would I start? I think at at for an 11year-old, I don't think you can. If I was going with an adult, I would talk about sort of the fundamentals of what a blockchain is and why that's such a unique architecture that enables digital property rights for the first time ever and lets property move at the speed of light. I'm not sure that Dash, it's my 11-year-old, uh, would get that. >> Or even the majority of the adults who are not really financially Detroit, right? >> Oh, I think they can get it. I actually think What would you tell someone who is >> How old are you? >> 26. >> Yeah. >> He doesn't really know about crypto. >> Oh, that's >> What would you tell him about crypto? That would make him more interested. But you need to explain things very simply. >> Yeah. >> To on board him. That one's super easy, I think. Uh, and then we can go back to how I'd explain it to Dash because I'm gonna try to do that tonight. Uh, I would start by saying, do you do you use PayPal or Venmo? Okay, everyone uses PayPal and Venmo and I think it's the perfect way in. So, why does PayPal exist? It exists because it lets us move money instantaneously. >> Why can it let us move money instantaneously? It's not because Elon Musk is a genius. David Saxs is a genius. It's really something simple, which is just one database. So, inside PayPal, if I want to send you $100, it can check and make sure I have $100 and send it to you instantaneously. It just moves a line like in an Excel document. The reason banks are so slow, so if I send you a check from my bank, your bank has to check with my bank back and forth >> to make sure I have the money. So all a blockchain is is the first time we able to have a database, one database that everyone in the world can see that updates in real time, but that's not controlled by a company. So PayPal is one database controlled by PayPal. A blockchain is just one database that you don't have to trust anyone to control. And that does amazing things. So it lets you move money around the world instantaneously whereas banks take days. But then maybe more fundamentally it lets you own a piece of digital property for the first time in history because a piece of digital property is just letters and numbers. And if you think about owning a string of letters and numbers, the problem is anyone can copy it. So who are you going to trust to maintain the database that says you own this piece of property? Are you going to trust Elon Musk? Are you going to trust Mark Zuckerberg? you trust Wells Fargo with a with a the Bitcoin blockchain, you don't have to trust anyone. And uh I just think that those are some of the most incredible breakthroughs ever. Digital property and moving money or moving property at the speed of light. I struggle to think of a financial advance in the last 200 years as big as those. But Julian, I still tell you, listen, I'm happy with PayPal or Venmo. Yeah. Why should I do crypto? >> Yeah, there are lots of reasons that you might do crypto. For one, you don't have to. Not everyone has to do crypto. Um, but for two, from a from a payments perspective, it's cheaper. But then it has these other incredible benefits which is you know for the all of history money has been controlled by governments which gives them extraordinary power to inflate it or change it or seize it. And this is the first time we've had the opportunity to have money that was separated from governments. And not just money but any database where you worry about the person who controls it having too much power. you can recreate that in blockchain. So if you're worried about X and Elon Musk having too much control over that platform, you could have that equivalent, but with Elon Musk removed. And uh it hasn't it hasn't changed many people's day-to-day lives, although you're starting to see that with things like stable coins. Um, but as a as a power that you want out there in the world, I think it's I think it's just a transformative idea. >> Yeah, the stable coins is just the one I would just tell everyone, even people who don't really care about crypto, stable coins, man, >> it's so easy. >> It's incredible. I cannot do anything anymore without stable coins. Once you've once you've we accept so many things. That's one of the incredible things about about f just stay on stable coins. We accept so many things as like just the way it is, >> right? So there's a 2% fee when you buy something. That's just the way it is. It's 8% when you send money abroad. That's just the way it is. When you get a paycheck, your money isn't earning interest. It goes into an interest free bank account, right? You can't put it to work immediately. That's just the way. It doesn't have to be that way, >> right? money could be frictionless. There could be no burden to open a bank account. Um, and I think that's going to uh substantially change the world in the next probably 3 years. I think it'll be faster than many people think. >> Why? Why? because we've had uh 4 years, maybe more, maybe 8 years, where people have been building the infrastructure for this technology, but it hasn't been able to be unleashed into the world because there's been a political divide that separated us from doing that. And so, the infrastructure from my point of view is actually overbuilt. It's like we laid these fiber optic cables before there was the internet. And so uh once you once you pull down that regulatory barrier I think it can expand so much faster than most technologies do right because most technologies you need the use case and the infrastructure to grow together and right now with stables we've built so much infrastructure and I think the use cases will be unleashed and catch up pretty quickly. I'm new to crypto. I get into in the industry. Usually what I do is I get more I mean probably depends where you're from, right? >> But the first appeal is more like the potential gains than the actual use case, right? Even for stable coins. Um probably stable coins is the second reason why you come into crypto. I mean not everyone but I would guess like many the industry is super noisy and that's the problem, right? you arrive, you say, "Okay, I'm going to use this thing, but I'm attracted by the gains." >> The problem is if you come to speculate, I mean, you basically come as an investor, but noise is very bad for investors. >> Mhm. >> Especially for new investors. Noise makes you panic. Buy high, sell low. How do you filter the signal from the noise in this crazy noisy industry that crypto is? >> Yeah. On a on a personal basis, how do I do it? I would say yes because the people who are watching are people. >> Yeah. >> And um and you can link that to your role, right? CIO, it's all about basically investment. >> Yeah. >> So explaining people, hey, look, like the reason why Matt and Hunter are so chill and optimistic all the time. >> There's two wars of crypto. >> Yep. >> Is because of that. And stop panicking. >> Yeah. It's not just crypto. It's every investment, right? Uh there's a famous I think it was Fidelity study of the best performing stock brokerage accounts. Uh and the best performers were the ones where the people were dead. >> Yeah. >> Which is which is an incredible fact. Um so much of the financial industry and then crypto has put this on steroids uh encourages people to try to trade, try to pick the winners to, you know, pick this asset over that asset. And for me that's just extraordinarily hard, maybe impossible. And you know, we were talking about it a little bit beforehand. All of investment literature and and almost all of the leading lights uh in investing from the from the traditional finance space said you shouldn't do that. You should just buy an index fund. I have a view that that trading alpha, which is to say like picking and choosing winners, is a fake story. It's virtually impossible. Why does that story exist though? Oh, because it's so tempting. And because the narrative is so loud. Because if if you take a hundred traders and they're making effectively random trades, five or 10 of them are going to blow the doors off and they're going to become extremely wealthy and they're going to shout their story from the rooftops. And then 90% are going to lose their shirt. And they're not going to tell you they lost their shirt cuz that's not what people do, right? They just keep quiet. So, you hear from the 10% and you don't hear from the 90%. Um, and I just think it's it's the hardest thing in the world to do. You have the the most sophisticated hedge funds in the world. I know you're a smart guy, but are you really going to go up against, you know, the most sophisticated hedge fun in the world? >> We all try. >> Of course, we all try and even I try on the edge. But my my view is there is one major source of alpha in the world and that's actually big picture alpha uh based mostly on behavioral biases. So when I look at crypto uh whatever alpha I have like the alpha that I got joining bitwise seven years ago and focusing on crypto was just a simple insight which was the world uh has this wrong that crypto is going to be more important in the future by a factor of 10 than it was when I joined that's probably off probably by a factor of 50 and the reason the world has it wrong is sort of classic behavioral biases anchoring bias people are inherently skeptical of digital things. Uh they probably first heard about crypto from a negative story like Mount Gox or Silk Road, etc. And so they're biased way over here. Whereas if you look at the actual data around crypto or you understand the technology, it's somewhere over here, right? It's it's it's pretty good to great. >> And that that is the alpha. If you then try to pick and choose between there really hard but if you if you if you feel confident in this view then all you do is you buy these assets and you hold them um and then you continue to hold them. I think there's some advantage in screening out assets that are terrible because crypto is an unregulated space. And so I think there's maybe some negative screening that you can do, but with 90% of my portfolio, it's just buy and hold Bitcoin or buy and hold uh an index of the of the top assets and just wait. You know, if I do that 20 years from now, I think my family will be will be happy with that result. What do you tell what do you tell someone who says, "But I don't want to wait 20 years." >> Yeah. Well, I mean, good luck. I mean, right. Look, we all we all have a part of our portfolio that doesn't want to wait. I do, too. Um, I consider that like a cost of learning, and I expect to lose money on it. Uh, and so I I think the the the classic like answer for what you should do is 8020. put 80% of your portfolio in this 20-year bet and then speculate to your heart's content on the other 20%. But there is no there's no easy pathway to, you know, massive wealth. It just doesn't exist. Um, and uh, and I think that's the that's the it's tough in crypto because there's so much noise around that, but I think that's the reality. >> There's no easy way to there's no fast way to easy. Sorry. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Sorry, guys. I didn't say it. He said it. I'll share one I mean one other one other fact. I'm the CIO at Bitwise. I'm not close enough to sort of the the the insider path on crypto to to know enough to outperform the market, right? Um and I'm in a relatively privileged position >> and uh there's just no way for me. So there are people out there who will do it, but it's not it's not for me. I read a tweet the other day that said it's complaining to that. I didn't want the 3 to 5x, so I choose the minus 99% instead. >> I think that's right. I think that's right. Yeah. >> You know, a funny a funny thing about coming into crypto from traditional finance is the numbers are just so skewed. In traditional finance, you're talking about 7% a year. 7% a year, >> right? That's 3 to 4x over a lifetime. And so from my perspective, right, like you know, crypto is up uh 12x since I joined Bitwise. Phenomenal. That's that's more than a lifetime of traditional finance gains in seven years, right? Phenomenal. So I think there is some relative scale issue at work. >> Yeah. But yet people will still tell you, "Yeah, but I know, but uh I'm not looking into the otherwise I would do S&P 500 or Yeah. Very true. It's tough game. Mark Twain said, "It's not what you don't know that gets you in trouble. It's what you know for sure that ain't so." >> Mhm. >> How does this principle apply to those who want to become better crypto investors? >> Yeah, I think it's exactly what we're talking about. I meet people every day who are absolutely convinced that Ethereum has no chance and Salana is gonna crush it. And then I meet people who are absolutely convinced that Slana is old school tech and it's Sue or Aptos or Avalanche or Barra or Modat or name your favorite and they're they have a 100% conviction that they're right. Um which is reflected by their their allocation >> their allocation. Yeah. So they're they're 100% in this asset. Maybe they're even short the other asset if they could be but their level of certainty is so high. I don't know. That's just really hard. Like if you've been around technology every time it's just it's it's really uncertain who the long-term winner will be. It was uncertain in search. It was uncertain in mobile. Uh it was uncertain in cloud. It's it's uncertain in AI. Like tell maybe that's a way to approach it. Take another category. Um are you 100% convinced that open AI will be the winner in AI? Like no. No way. not a chance. But people in crypto are so tribal and so convinced that they have this right. >> Um I think it's just really tough. It would be terrible to be in crypto for 15 years and have negative returns while the market, you know, 50x's. Uh that would be painful. I think it happens to a lot of people though. I think it happens to a lot of people because they're overallocated to right? Yes. to the to the to the minus 99% instead of the 3 to 5x. Right. >> That's right. And again, it's not to not do it. It's just to 8020 of it. You have to scratch that is. You can't like I can't resist it. I can't resist not spec like >> No way. I >> We We could You can ask me what I what >> Yeah. I want to know what you're doing in your 20% of like uh itch. >> Yeah. Uh I'll answer that for sure. Um but you have to allow yourself to do it. Uh, but you shouldn't allow yourself to do it with everything cuz you're you're I don't know, maybe you're way better than me, but um I'm not that good for sure. >> You're a CIO so you understand portfolio allocation. >> Yeah. >> So before understanding this 20%. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> How much is crypto >> of my own personal portfolio? >> Uh liquid. >> Yeah. Uh it's probably 30 or 40% of my liquid portfolio. And then I work in crypto and I'm a shareholder in Bitwise. Um, you know, so the the overall allocation is really significant. >> Yeah. >> How responsible is that? >> I think it's fine. I think it's fine. >> I love it. >> That's what I wanted to hear. >> Yeah. Look, I have a high degree of conviction uh on this space. Um I wish I owned uh more Bitcoin to be sure. Yeah, I think we all do, right? We probably all own less Bitcoin now than we used to own in the past. >> Yeah. Yeah. We should all own more Bitcoin. So, so what's the 20%. What's the 20%. >> Uh right now there there are two areas that I think are um undervalued. >> So, one I think there's going to be a DeFi renaissance that's really significantly bigger than most people think. >> So, um that's part of the the 20%. The reason for that is um you we talked about this infra being built up but the use not expanding because of this regulatory barrier. >> So you have like like a dam that's filling up to the very top. If you look at DeFi, that's exactly the case. There's incredible technology and incredible infrastructure and incredible revenue and users and proof that it can survive in volatile markets up and down. It's it's it's so phenomenal to watch. But both the penetration into real world assets has been limited and then the tokconomics of the projects has been terrible because if they had any real value drivers they went to jail and I think that that's changed and so I think there's uh I think there's a massive unlock there and then I don't want to name uh individual names but there there's some of the emergent layer ones that I think are interesting and I like owning a little bit Interesting. >> What's a great investor? >> A great investor is someone who's comfortable with their investment and doesn't panic. Uh to me, that's the whole game. >> How hard is it to become a good investor? >> It's really easy. It's really easy. >> That's so interesting. >> It's really easy. just 8020 it and you're already um you know there's a I I come from an index investing background right >> what's what is index investing >> sure it's it's it's you know instead it's owning the S&P 500 in stocks which say instead of trying to pick and choose stocks you just own the entire market and uh a funny little story from index investing history is it was it was created in the 1970s and early 1980s and when it launched it was seen as unamerican And and there was this phenomenal uh statement, I think it was from someone at Fidelity, which was an active shop, which was, I don't think the majority of Americans will be comfortable getting average returns. And the reason that's funny is by definition they have to because they own the entire market. So by definition, they're going to get those average returns. But he was the the point they were making is no one would be comfortable with this indexbased strategy. The reality is uh the long-term investors in index based strategies historically beat 70 to 80% of all investors. >> So you can be in the top 25% of investors by just doing nothing. >> It's so that part is easy but you just have to hold yourself back. >> Yeah. Actually, I read uh I told you the other day I read three books 10 years ago, 12 years ago about investing to understand how the hell do I become financially free and you read all these I mean I read the little common sense of investing Jack Bogle. Um a random walk down Wall Street. >> Yeah. >> Burton Mal and then Tony Robbins when he mastered the game. >> They all say the same thing. Buy index funds. Buy buy ETFs. Right. Y >> and do nothing. >> Um they'll say the same thing and even Buffett says the day the day I die I'll put everything in SAP 500 because I don't think people can beat the market. And in one of these books I think it was the one of Tony Robbins he was actually saying not 70 to 80% he was saying 96% of the active fund managers don't outperform the market after taxes and fees and all that stuff. Right. >> That's right. >> Which is crazy, right? >> Think about that. And those those are guys getting huge salaries with huge teams today using the most advanced AI tools, right? Using the most sophisticated traders. Uh they probably have direct relationships with the people running these companies and 96% of them can't beat my son Dash who owns index funds, right? He is crushing these people making $10 million a year picking stocks. >> Um and that's just the facts. I mean, those are just the data. And I think it's doubly true in crypto for what it's worth. >> That's what I wanted to ask. 100% obviously 100%. >> But what's what's the S&P 500 in crypto? Is it just owning Bitcoin? No. Or is it owning Great question. So So if you think crypto is just money, then it's just owning Bitcoin. But if you think crypto can be money or it can be tech, um, then it's owning the top five, the top 10, the top 20 high quality assets, trying to screen out the junk. We can talk about that. >> What's a high quality? I can see your I can see I can see the eyebrows. >> It's getting too good. >> Yeah, it's getting too good. Um, look at you. I talked about this earlier that there may be alpha in screening things out, right? And I I think if you look back through crypto's history, you can we can all identify some things that we wish we had screened out, right? So Luna, I know, is an example of something that people wish they had screened out. Uh FTX's token is something that you wish you could screen out. I think there are ways to do that. Um I think you can I think you can look at uh you can at least get warning flags from some of those assets. if they're not available from, you know, highquality custodians or if there's no in the US, no US dollar rails to get in out of those assets or if there's flaws in the tokconomic design. And um you're not going to get them all right and you may miss a few highquality assets, but um I think you can get some of them, but even if you don't, even if you just buy the index, you're going to do fine. The thing about crypto is the space is undervalued by a factor of 10 uh in terms of where it's going. It's important in the world. So if you get that 10, even if you bought some things that went to zero, as long as that didn't spook you out of the market, who cares? But do this index fund of the top 10 or 15 or 20 beat Bitcoin? >> Oh, I don't know about that. I don't It's so hard to beat Bitcoin. >> I don't know if it'll beat Bitcoin. >> You said before 90% of my crypto is in Bitcoin, right? Oh, Bitcoin and and and top 10 assets. So, I invest in the next one. But here's the thing. Even if you don't beat Bitcoin, I still would buy the index because uh otherwise there's just going to be a moment when a friend calls you up and is like, you got to look at this thing, right? And you're going to get excited about it. It's going to have high returns and you're going to jump into it and you're going to blow yourself up. I I think the the the controlling your own personal behavior is it's the whole key. It's the whole key. So if you can it will it be Bitcoin? I don't know. Bitcoin's really amazing and it's going after the largest market in the world. Um so that's a pretty good bet. But I do think it's nice to have a way to resist temptation. Our ETFs, you said you were working, you were CEO of ETF.com. >> Yeah. Yeah, you're qualified to talk about ETFs and to say it at least, >> I guess. >> Are ETFs a good thing? >> Yeah. So, there are two ways to answer that question. I don't know which angle you're going to, but from one perspective, the core thing an ETF does is it lets my uncle invest on the same terms and the same cost as the Harvard endowment or the largest institutions in the world. So, you know that because these institutions own the same ETF that my father owns in his retirement account, right? They use it to get exposure to the S&P 500 or bonds or whatever. It's such a good deal. And that's true in crypto, too. The Bitcoin ETFs are priced at such low levels that you would have to be putting 510 billion of money to work buying Bitcoin to get the same deal. So, it's an incredible democratic idea. There's this other debate within crypto which is the you know not your keys not your crypto. Does it make sense to have an intermediated financial product right instead of owning Bitcoin directly? Um >> what's your answer to that? >> Oh yeah absolutely man for sure. Look I love people who uh own Bitcoin directly. I think that's phenomenal. Um >> do you? >> I don't. Yeah I don't. I know. which is shocking to some people, but I'm not I wouldn't trust myself from a security perspective. I'm the CIO, not the CTO. Um, and I have a great deal of confidence in our ETF setup. Uh, can I ask a question about that? I was actually interviewing Ben from Bid. >> Yep. I'm actually not a security expert, right? But I was essentially saying, "Hey, like if you guys, we're talking about self-custody, but like the fact that they got hacked shows that because they're sort of self-custodying their their client's assets, right?" >> Yeah. >> If with all the security measures they have in place by bit, I think they have 20 billions in aum. >> Yeah. >> Um I mean clients assets, they can get hacked. It means that almost everyone can get hacked. >> Mhm. >> And then it just then they said, "Oh, look, this part was basically one that we didn't do internally. We're using another external company." And then I started to kind of think or I even asked him, I was like, "Do you think for example ETFs, right, the Bitcoin is somewhere?" >> Mhm. >> Which means there is still a risk. So, so even when you said before, I'm not comfortable, especially when you have a certain amount of money. I want to basically delegate that. But what you need to understand when you delegate your crypto, I mean, when you have your own crypto, you're responsible for it. So, you could lose it very easily. But also, when you're delegating it and it's one of the key uh learnings he had was if I start to delegate some part of these things, >> I become more complacent about it's fine like right and then you realize maybe it's not right. Sometimes it's not. >> Yeah. >> How is obviously an exchange and an ETF is very different. There's there's probably much less movement of the assets, but like how is how different is it in terms of security? An exchange and an ETF? And how likely would it be that something similar happens to a to an ETF? And you know, people might say, "Kevin, you're so dumb with your questions." But in this industry, you have to ask the dumb questions because all the that happened. >> Yeah. >> Now or 2 years ago, like it's because people were taking things for granted. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I think it's really important to ask. I mean, the the level of security procedures and sort of the the fracturing of crypto into multiple wallets that ETF custodians do limits the risk. And you know I I know in terms of the level of due diligence that Bitwise applies and the various security protocols in terms of where crypto can and cannot be sent out of custodians gives me a great deal of confidence in that approach. Um, you can never say never, right, in this industry in particular. And I hope we don't ever get to that point and I feel confident in Bitwise's approach, but we're not the only asset manager in the space. Some haven't been in crypto that long. Um, so I worry I worry a little bit about that. Uh, but the, you know, the good news is these are the custodians have gotten very institutional in nature. The assets are all held in cold storage. if they're trading right, it should never touch an exchange. Um, and so I feel very confident in it, but I completely understand the other side and I love people who self-custody >> their own bitcoin. >> So we talked about traditional investing before. >> Basically all these books you can read two, three, five, six00 pages, they will tell you buy by buyers, right? or buy buy an ETF, the S&P 500, by the NASDAQ. >> Yeah. And then we sell in crypto, buy an index, right? How much does this traditional investing principle work in crypto? >> Oh, it it all works. We even have our own words for it. Like what is what is hodal? Hodal is buy and hold, right? If you put it in a pinstripe suit and put a top hat on it, same thing as buy and hold. Same thing you read in those books. You just make fun of it here in crypto. >> Um, you know what is uh buy the dip. It's dollar cost average, right? We just use a different word for it. Um, I think with a few small exceptions where I can't think of a direct tie, almost everything that is true about traditional investing is true in crypto. So costs matter. Uh, long-term buy and hold will outperform most uh, asset picking. Um, dollar cost averaging is a good idea. you should buy low and sell when it's high to keep in your your tolerance. There are a few areas where I think there are differences. Crypto is a less efficient market. So I think there is arbitrage opportunities that exist in crypto that are real that don't exist in the traditional world at the scale they do in crypto. I think staking is a fairly unique thing in crypto for which there's no sort of direct analogy in traditional investing. But the same rules of like buy, hold, rebalance, those are going to, you know, those those have worked in investing for hundreds of years. I don't think there's anything about crypto that's changed it. >> There's 10,000 new coins every day. >> Mhm. >> I mean, could be much more, could be less, but >> yeah, >> I read something like that, you know, 80,000 a week. >> Yeah. >> Millions of coins now out there. >> Yeah. >> What are the crypto assets that I can buy and hold for the long term? Yeah. Um, Bitcoin. No, look, look, the way I think, >> Bitcoin and Bitcoin, >> Bitcoin, Bitcoin, and Bitcoin. Um, I don't think you could just buy it and and be dead. I think you have to rebalance it. You know, I would guess that Bitcoin, ETH, Salana will be here for the long term and everything else underneath that may or may not. Um uh you know I I I >> that's so important. >> That's so important because when you say hey 80/20 that means like hey you're 80%. I mean that's why also Raul Paul says all the time right he says don't this up don't this up. Yeah 80 70 to 90% should be in top three assets. Yeah. Otherwise, you're just going to end up like most people are ending up now, right? In the middle of a bull run most likely, but wrecked, wrecked, and depressed and down. And that's right. It's the saddest thing in the world. Whereas, if you have if you have the 80% in mostly Bitcoin, you're upund what percent over the last year, like pretty good. So, what if you got wrecked? You know what you said before? And that's so that's so important for people to understand but they don't and they don't want to hear it which is let's say you're at the beginning of a bull market so you're in a bare market you look at okay uh I think we were at like 1 trillion more or less at the time right y >> and then you say >> and maybe maybe previous bare market maybe 200 billion I don't remember right but you go 200 billion or let's say 100 billion to 3 trillion. So that's 30x for the whole industry and then down to 1 trillion. But you're still like up 5x. >> Yeah. >> Yet people end up with less money. They not only lose their money, they put in more money and they lose that money too, right? >> That's right. >> While the industry goes up 5x. >> Yes. Yes. >> 30x from bottom to top and then 5x from bottom to bottom. And then you're thinking okay 1 trillion I was actually tweeting about that like a year and a half ago. I was like the industry will go from 1 trillion to 10 trillion whatever what is but let's say 10x and then we go back down to 5 trillion. Yeah. So basically will be up 5x yet you will manage to lose all your money >> and and some more. >> That's that's the thing that most people don't understand like how is that possible? >> Yeah. Yeah. And that's really sad. And it's really sad and you could do even better if you had a target allocation. You sold, you know, when it went up a lot, you bought when it went down a lot. Um, but yeah, don't let that happen to you, right? Like if if you're in crypto right now, you've had this insight that most of the world hasn't had, which I feel very confident is right, which is that this thing is just getting started and it's going to be really important. It's a generational opportunity. You've already done the hard work. Don't then you know shoot yourself in the foot. You said it's just getting started. >> It's just getting started. Yeah. >> Tell me more. Again, I have to repeat the tweet from before. I didn't want the 3 to 5x so I choose the minus 99% instead which is hitting this hits hard a lot of uh people in crypto. >> Yeah. >> 325x this is a tweet. What's the realistic long-term upside for from here for assets like Bitcoin, ETH and Soul and you are the best position to understand that because you're seeing institutions and what they're doing and you know how much money they have >> and therefore you know what's the potential upside and before you said when I went into bitwise 2017 I was thinking 10x I think more 50x right so tell us >> more about that. Yeah, I mean I'll give you two quick views on on Bitcoin specifically. I think until Bitcoin is as large as gold, we were just getting started. It's still early. And I think once we get to as large as gold, then we can talk about, you know, is it 5x bigger than gold? Is it 3x bigger than gold? Is it 2x bigger than gold? But there's still a 10x until we match gold. and try to think of another area where there's a a physical and a digital analog where the physical is still bigger. Is physical newspapers bigger than digital newspapers? Is physical advertising bigger than digital advertising? Are DVDs bigger than stream? There's just I've really struggled to come up with even one example. >> Um, and so I think until we get to Bitcoin, you're actually still I mean until we get to gold level, you're actually still early. And it's only after gold that uh that we start counting like how big could this thing be. Um so you have a 10x until you're no longer early, right? And then beyond that. The other angle is from an institutional perspective. The thing about the thing about institutional investors is their starting point is what's called a benchmark portfolio. And a benchmark portfolio means owning everything. So like an index of stocks, the S&P 500 is you can think of that as the benchmark portfolio, right? That's where they start. And then if they want to overweight Nvidia or underweight Ford or overweight Tesla, they can tweak around the edges, but they have to get to this starting point. Crypto is now part of the global capital markets, right? It's $3 trillion. Stocks are a hundred trillion. Bonds are another hundred trillion or something. So it's a sliver. It's like a percent. But of those $200 trillion, they have no exposure to Bitcoin. They don't own it yet. So, it's not like a little bit of money has to come into Bitcoin. I think institutions have to buy a trillion, a trillion half dollars worth of Bitcoin until they get to level. Imagine what a trillion half dollars coming into Bitcoin does to the price. Like, who is going to sell? How much will it go up? I think it'll be really significant. People look at the Bitcoin ETFs last year. They did $37 billion. People put $37 billion in. The price went up substantially. This is more buying than selling. I think you got to put a trillion dollars into this just to get to level. And um it's just too much money. It just has to it has to come in. So I think the people who are worried that all the I actually think there's never been on a risk adjusted basis a better time to buy Bitcoin than right now. I think it's eliminated all the risks of failure. Those are all gone. And I still think it has 10x upside until it's getting started, until it's no longer early. Um and then I think it has upside from there. What does that mean for the rest of the industry? This is a very tricky question because the logic would be if Bitcoin is the most liquid asset, right, goes up 10x, the rest should go up much more. But what we've been seeing is actually that's not the case. >> Yeah, I actually think the nature of that uh is changing. So the the the reason I think there used to be this Bitcoin goes up and everything goes up uh more is that crypto was driven mostly by speculation, right? the hope that it will be better in the future than it is today. And I think where we're at right now is it's it's starting to be driven more by fundamentals. So like if Bitcoin goes up because governments adopt it, what should that mean for ETH? >> Not much, >> right? ETH is going to have to win on its own terms. Salana is going to have to win on its own terms. Uh Uni is going to have to win on its particular terms. And I think this idea that that Bitcoin will drag these other assets up is probably from an era where crypto was mostly speculative >> and retail >> and retail. And I think we're moving into an era where it's more utility and more institutional. And so you're going to see these assets have very different returns. It's going to look more like the stock market. Does Nvidia going up help Ford? No. Right. They're basically irrelevant to each other. And I think we'll get to the point in 5 or 10 years where Bitcoin and uh Salana are basically not quite irrelevant because they're both within this crypto ecosystem, but they have they have a loose affiliation from their returns. >> Which one do you think goes up the most in the next 10 years? >> I don't know. I'm telling you, I think this DeFi revolution is real. >> I think it's bigger than people think. >> Nice. >> Yeah. We're in this beautiful office. Mhm. Bitwise office. I have a beautiful Bitwise t-shirt. I have to ask you >> what is Bitwise if you had to explain it to your mom. >> Yeah. Bitwise is a specialist crypto asset man. So we help people invest in crypto. We use our expertise to build products that are sophisticated on the inside but easy to understand on the outside so that you can get exposure to the space in a way that's safe and secure and uh and low cost in many cases. So I think that's that's what we do. I think we we do it well. We've been doing it for seven plus years. There's two words of the crypto space. You write a weekly CIO memo. >> Mhm. But you don't do this when you're at your desk. You do it uh while hacking and running. That's right. Why? Because it's actually the same thing we've been talking about. When you're at your desk looking at the screen, crypto is so hard to understand. Because you're looking at Twitter, it's all extreme opinions. And then you're looking at the price move and it's up and it's down. and you're letting the price movement influence what you're thinking about the particular market activity, right? So, you see a piece of news, you think, "This is good for crypto. It fits my long-term view about where this industry is going." And then the price craters, and you start to ask yourself, wait, wait, am I wrong? And, you know, that's healthy to a degree, but it's hard to get away and think, what does this really mean? When you look at a screen, you have to you have to get out. So, I go high. >> How much are you guilty of that? >> Oh, you're a professional. You're a CIO. You understand long-term investing. You're working for a very serious I look at company in the institutional space. >> Yeah. >> But you talk about looking at Twitter >> and the prices and being kind of affected. Yeah. How guilty are you? I'm totally guilty. Yeah. How guilty are you? >> I'm just kidding. No, you can't get away from it. You can't. And it's important. You got to be smart. >> Addicted kids. >> Yeah. Aren't we all? >> Um, aren't we all? >> We're all We're all addicted kids. >> We're all We're all dens of the core. >> But but you have to you have to separate that from your investment decision-m except in that 10 20% of the portfolio where you know, knock yourself out. >> Yeah. But yeah, I can't get away. Can't turn off X. Which is why you go hike >> and run. Yeah. And that's literally where you start to have like all your ideas or I write I write the whole thing usually in my head while I run or hike. How long is a memo? Oh, they're like 800 words. So, I'll I'll write at least the full intro in my mind. I I sort of write by speaking. I find it easier. So, I'll write it in my head and then I'll try to remember it when I get home and and type it out. >> What do you mean exactly when you say I write it in my head? >> Yeah. You see the words, you use >> I see the words and I >> sing the words like I I I mostly speak the words to myself. I was a speech writer in a former life >> and then you remember them >> and I remember them and I write them down as soon as I get back from the run or sometimes sometimes if I have my phone I'll stop and take a note. Um but it's you know I otherwise otherwise there's a screen that's calling out for you and Slack messages and you need to get that separation in crypto. Again, this is like a 10-year trend. How do you how do you focus on that trend when the price is moving? >> So, so every week, you know, you're going to go for a run at a certain moment of the week, and that run or those runs will be basically for this CIO memo. >> That's right. Yeah. Yeah. It's a couple It's usually a couple um one to sort of think about what you're doing and then one where I where I actively write it in my head. And usually that it's not the full memo. It's not like I come home and it comes out word for word, but it's about 50 60% of the words that end up on the page. How much can you use AI for this memo? >> I I had a conversation with Mike Novagrats last last summer >> and he was telling me he was like, "I'm so bullish on this AI stuff." AI agent like he was a basic catching like the thing like couple of months before. >> Yeah. >> It kind of blew up and he was giving example. He was like, "Hey, um, Scaramucci, uh, Anthony Scaramucci wrote a book on Bitcoin and I had to to to write the the the the words in the beginning." Do you say four words? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. The four words. >> Yeah. >> And uh, he asked me to do a thousand words, but he was like, "Man, like thousand words? What the fuck?" like and then he just like used AI and he said, "Hey, >> if you were Mike and you had to write four words about this, this this he put the whole book in there." Yeah. >> And then like the AI helped him a lot and then he just literally likes I mean change a few things and it was done, right? >> Yeah. >> How much >> can you use a mix of running and hiking in the nature and AI? >> I love it. I love it. I'm really bullish on AI. I use it all the time um for data gathering or to write sort of formulaic things. Um I'm on the board of an AI investing company. But for the memo, not at all. Zero. Um my view is that the the challenge in writing the memo is actually the thinking. Once you do the thinking and once you have it really really clear in your head what you're trying to say, then it it writes pretty quickly. And I haven't found a way for AI to yet do the really clear thinking for me. Maybe it will. I'm not counting it out, but so far so far I don't use it. For this podcast, I'm actually thinking about something similar. A friend of mine was like the other day was like, you should take for me every episode is a blank piece of blank sheet, right? So it's absolutely not scalable. But that's how you have the best conversation. You have to understand who do I have in front of me and how can we get the best out of this person that is useful for people who are listening like just otherwise it would be like most of these conversations that I see too much online which is like very shallow right. >> Yeah. Yeah. So you could have like a template, but if you have a template, you get bored. People get bored, right? >> But then with AI, I was thinking, I mean, actually, my friend was like, you could take all your previous episode, dump them into an AI, and then if you're able to have this kind of conversation prep that I have often, not always, but often, I could take the the notes from the prep and then put in the AI like that analyze all the I don't know. I don't know. Maybe, maybe, but maybe. But >> I mean, my conversation is so again like the more it's not scalable or if I'm recording 15 episodes like this month, like it's going to be crazy preparation, right? >> But it makes the whole thing so much better. I don't know. I don't know. >> I think it makes it much better. I still think maybe it'll get there, but I still think there's a there's like a there's like a 20% that you that we haven't yet replaced. So, I don't know. Maybe it could throw out a few good questions, but has to be the questions you want to know. >> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. >> Yeah. Exactly. But I have to say, I interviewed an AI, you know, the virtual ecosystem. They had these AI agents and one of them is called Luna >> and she has like a million followers. She's like an AI doll playing music live on Tik Tok. She has a million followers like since like and she's worth like $17 million. Like it's crazy. So I went to the studio and I interviewed her. >> That's amazing. >> For like 70 minutes. 70 minutes. Like an hour and 10 minutes. We talked. >> Yeah. >> And one of her big plan this year is actually to have her own podcast. >> So I was like, "Holy shit." Like, you know, like maybe we're just coping like, "Hey, my CIO memo, I can't really use AI. Me my podcast, I can't really use AI." But we're probably I don't know. Maybe there's some cop in there. >> That's incredible. That's incredible. >> What's something that you believe in that most people would not agree with? >> Well, I mean, come on. Uh I think crypto is that's that's too easy, right? It's crypto that this is actually important. You think most people would not agree with the fact that crypto is important and it's going to get big. >> I think 95% of people still don't think crypto is important and they just sign a 0% chance to the idea >> here. We have one. >> There you go. Um we still love you. >> We do uh that Bitcoin could be a globally important monetary asset. Um and I think most people may agree with stable coins. I don't get a lot of push back on stable coins, but the idea that that Bitcoin could be a globally important monetary asset or that we could be using crypto in our day-to-day lives in three years uh on a widespread basis. I don't think I think maybe 98% of the world disagrees with that. >> Do you think that's wrong? >> I'm not sure about the numbers, but the only thing I want to say is I've been in crypto since 20 late 2018. I thought I was late >> like we all do, right? When I man, I'm late. Yeah, there's this very weird thing in crypto where if it's a bare market, for example, two years ago, everyone got completely wrecked with all these exchanges going bust. Obviously, after that, it's kind of lame and kind of like you don't want to tell people to measure in crypto, right? So, you don't feel good about it. And then you think, "Yeah, but at some point when things get better, I should be proud and say kind of like this is my moment, right?" >> Yeah. Yeah. >> I mean, stay humble, but like this is my moment. Hey, I was right. We always say like the best drug is not uh is not making money is actually being right. Right. Being proven right. >> Yeah. But when crypto goes up or let's say when Bitcoin goes up, the attention goes on so much like it goes on all the wrong places that still makes you feel that you're kind of lame to be here and it make most of the people >> out there not trust it and be like this is lame and weird. So basically, >> yeah, I think I'm not sure about 95 or 98, but like there's way too many people that still don't understand. And the reason is because because humans attention goes on obviously is disgusted by all this stuff when it goes down 95% and everybody loses all their money. But when it goes up there's too much happening and the attention goes on the wrong thing. Which is why I'm doing this podcast. I'm like how do I talk to the most credible people? >> Yeah. And the same as a Bitwise is doing in crypto with like this, you know, long-term investing, they have boring >> like I'm trying to do the same in education like >> look at the right people were doing the right things and stop obviously yeah like the meme coin whatever like you just it's great but it feels good for like five minutes but then you lose everything and then then you don't come back or like you you always feel like this industry is kind of scammy which it kind of is right. So it's to answer your question. Yeah, it's it still feels like the image is is not is not good. >> The image is really not good. And um the other thing one thing that strikes me about that I mean I have lots of thoughts on what you said there is uh you know the market is mostly Bitcoin and then some ETH and some Salana and then a handful of very small assets. But the the media attention and weight that is paid to meme coins or to these scams is like almost equivalent, >> right? Which is an incredible fact >> uh because again the market is 70% Bitcoin uh and it's it's 90% you know Bitcoin, ETH, Salana, BNB but is the media attention that no absolutely it's mostly on this this negative stuff. I was talking about that with uh Raner from Cryptob. >> Yeah. >> And I was challenging him. I was like, "Hey, you have multiple shows, but most of them are about trading. Do you really believe that people can make money trading?" He's like, "Yeah, I start to believe a bit more, but actually I don't do that much, right?" And then I'm like, you talked about all these meme coins or AI agent, etc. Like, what's the ratio? Same, right? What's the ratio? You're doing media and I understand. I mean, media, I understand the the attention game, mind, attention. So you need to give people what they want to click on and read, but you also need to do it kind of the right way, otherwise they're going to get screwed. So do do you want your attention or do you want the right education and have to use your attention the right is very hard, right? >> Very hard. >> So I told him, what percentage of your shows are all this crap? >> Mhm. >> And what percentage because I was your portal is 90% Bitcoin. >> Yeah. >> So therefore 90% of your shows should be in Bitcoin. Right. Right. Right. >> Same. Right. And it's like obviously yeah we don't do that >> because people Right. But like that's the freaking problem in media outside of crypto but also in crypto it's a big problem. >> It's so hard. I mean yeah you know I was running ETF.com and we literally could have written one story that said buy an index fund and then and then that's it and then period. And but that's not a good media business, right? Uh and I think this is a really I think it's a really big issue. M >> um we spend so much time focused on on these wrong things. I don't know that there's a way out of it. Eventually the real things prove themselves in a way that can't be denied. And I think we've we're starting to get there with Bitcoin. We're starting to get there with stable coins. >> Um but yeah, there is this media circus. It's one of the reasons I'm sympathetic. I'm not a maxi, but I'm sympathetic to the Bitcoin maxis. uh in the sense that this circus does color people's perception of this market in a way where if it was just Bitcoin and we were talking about governments adopting it as a sovereign asset and you know regulation improving that would give one view um so yeah it's a painful reality my approach to this is uh I come to the US I record 15 episodes I keep them 1 2 3 4 5 months I don't release them when it's the right moment. >> The attention. Oh, you're doing an IPO. Oh, you're doing a TGE. Oh, um there's something around your company. >> Boom. >> I realize it. So, the attention is there. The content is not necessarily about the the drama, whatever, but I have people attention. >> I like that. >> And >> yeah, >> it's still serious, right? >> But like and I started to understand this better um since mid last year and like the views and everything exploded a lot. I was like, how do I stay credible by not surfing the latest wave, which by definition means you're too late already because you're giving information about AI agents when people click on AI agents >> or the other thing I was doing I was using my seven eight years in crypto to try to anticipate some trends uh >> to be able to say I need to get this founder just before they blow up. >> Boom. And then you're kind of seen as like the podcast credible also that almost wizard service before free, right? >> Very hard to do especially in studio. But >> you have to do that, right? Otherwise, >> yeah. >> Otherwise, you're just surfing and people at the end of the day people get wrecked and and if they get wrecked, they're not going to stay. And that's a big problem that we have, right? >> That's exactly right. >> It's so related. >> Yeah. Yeah. I love that. >> What's your biggest prediction for the next 12 months? Uh biggest prediction within crypto. Um I I I'm really bullish. I'm really bullish. >> I mean I think uh I know that's too easy to say. We can get to a more specific prediction if you want, but uh unless you lived in crypto the last four years, you didn't know how challenging it was and how repressed the industry was uh from the regulatory uh overhang. And as a result, I think people don't understand how good it is now and how significant uh forward will be in crypto. So my my general prediction is just it's going to be an amazing year in crypto. I know it's noisy. I know it's good news and bad news, but I think that I think it just tidal wave and positive change. I usually never do like price prediction and all that stuff because it's kind of noise, but >> now that we talk about that, I'm so bullish. People are kind of like, >> yeah, it's very noisy. So that one day they're super bullish after they're down a lot of people got wrecked on all these  coins, right? And they had the majority of the portfolio in. >> So to give a bit of hope, yeah, I remember some time ago you guys released uh a paper giving some price targets. >> We did 2025 for Bitcoin, Ethan, Solana. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Tell me more about that. >> Ah, I mean it's we'll start with Bitcoin. We think Bitcoin's going to 200,000 or above this year. >> 2025. >> 25. My view is if you look at uh if you look at Bitcoin, I don't want to go too far into prices, but if you look at Bitcoin since the ETF launched, it's done two things. So, first it ran from 50,000 to 72,000 and then it traded sideways and then it ran from 72,000 to 100,000 and then effectively traded sideways with a lot of volatility. I think that tells you everything you need to know about the market. The the ETF introduced structurally more demand for Bitcoin than there is new supply. It bought half a million Bitcoin last year. We're producing 165,000. So, there's more demand. So, why did it trade to 72,000? That was the last all-time high. People are people. They were willing to sell at the all-time highs. Why did it trade to 100,000 and then stop there? It's a round number. That's it. So people were willing to trade at $100,000. >> I love it. >> The reason I bring that up is I think if we get north of 100,000 the next place where 200 200, right? And it'll probably stop there. And um you know, boy, that doesn't sound like a sophisticated CIO view. >> You said it before. Yeah, but you said before I have one alpha, which is like the long-term big alpha. >> That's right. The kiss. Keep it stupid simple. >> Keep it stupid simple. There's more demand than supply and people are people. I think that tells you how this people are people. >> ETH. >> Yeah, I think ETH I'm bullish on everything. I realize maybe that's not that interesting. I think ETH will get back to a new all-time high. I think ETH is the contrarian bet in crypto right now. And uh here's my argument for ETH. What are the things people are most excited about outside of Bitcoin in a serious way right now? They're probably most excited about stable coins. They're most excited about tokenization and they're most excited about aentic AI. Right? We just talked about those things. Where are those three things happening? It's all happening on ETH, right? ETH is the largest platform for stable coins. It's got the highest share of tokenization, like an 80% market share, and most of the agentic AI stuff is on ETH or base or whatever. >> Um, I don't know. Like I know Salana has been the cool kid because it's been the center of meme coins and the technology is very exciting, but if you look at the things people are bullish on, they're they're based on ETH and so I'm pretty bullish about ETH. So I think it gets back to new all-time highs. I think Salana also does well. The and and maybe people ask, well, how can ETH do well and Salana do well? It's because I think we're going to 100x the number of people interacting with these blockchains and they have different value props. Salana and E. One is more institutional, one is more retail. Um, and so I think they're both going to do fine. So I think I think Salana will do quite well as well. >> What does that mean in terms of price for Salena? >> 400 450 maybe more. >> Not 10x. That's the challenge for people. But 2x is great. 3x is amazing, >> right? That's uh those are in traditional finance. Those are life-changing returns and in crypto they can be really significant as well. >> Thank you so much for doing this, Matt. Thank you for having me. That was awesome. Thank you for being a steward in the crypto space. We need more people like you who stay optimistic through the thick and thin and who have the right mindset, the boring and the long-term mindset. Your mindset is boring, not you. >> I know what you mean. I'm I'm down. Boring is good. >> Boring is good. Investing should be like like watching a paint uh dry. In crypto, too, we always say in crypto, crypto is a get rich slow scheme and a get wrecked quick scheme. >> I think that's very right. Um, we need more people like you who can help new investors navigate this super noisy industry and not just say, "Hey, I'm part of crypto," but actually make money, which is a big problem we talked about today. Right. >> Mhm. >> Thank you so much. >> Thanks for having me. This was fun. [Music]
